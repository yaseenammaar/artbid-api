##Coding Rules and Styles.

------------------------------

- All keys in firestore json data should be in snake case. This is true for data in POST request too.  
        `phone_number : "+910000000000"`
 

- Use pascal case or camel case for variables and function names. Preferably, camel case for variables and pascal case for function names.
